# Data Cleaning with Pandas

In this data cleaning project, I utilized the powerful data manipulation and analysis library, Pandas, within a Jupyter Notebook environment to clean and prepare a dataset containing customer information for a call center company. The dataset included valuable information such as contact details, customer names, addresses, and a binary indicator of whether each customer falls into the "Paying Customer" category.

Project Objectives:

Data Assessment: 
The project began with an initial assessment of the dataset. This involved examining the data's structure, checking for missing values (NaNs), identifying data types, and understanding the data distribution.

Data Cleaning: 
The main focus of the project was on data cleaning, which included several key tasks:

1. Handling Missing Data: NaN values in the dataset were addressed by either imputing reasonable values (if applicable) or removing rows with missing data, depending on the context.
2. Addressing Data Integrity: Ensuring data integrity involved detecting and correcting inconsistencies, duplications, or inaccuracies in the customer information.
3. Data Type Conversion: Adjusting data types to ensure they match the intended use of the data.
4. Categorization and Classification: The "Paying Customer" column was reviewed and standardized to ensure it adhered to predefined categories (e.g., "Yes" or "No").

Data Validation:
Data validation steps were implemented to check for logical consistency and anomalies within the dataset, ensuring that the cleaned data accurately represented customer information.

Project Outcome:
The data cleaning project resulted in a well-structured, clean dataset ready for further analysis. The cleaned dataset provided valuable insights into the call center company's customer base, including customer demographics and the distribution of paying customers.In this data cleaning project, I utilized the powerful data manipulation and analysis library, Pandas, within a Jupyter Notebook environment to clean and prepare a dataset containing customer information for a call center company.
